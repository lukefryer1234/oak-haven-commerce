# Synchronization Test

This file was created on Tue 29 Apr 2025 10:39:32 BST to demonstrate the cross-platform synchronization process.

## How Synchronization Works

1. Changes are made locally
2. Changes are committed to Git
3. Changes are pushed to GitHub
4. Other devices pull these changes
5. Firebase deployments reflect the latest code

Delete this file once you've verified the synchronization process is working correctly on all your devices.
